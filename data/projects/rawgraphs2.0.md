RAWGraphs is an open source data visualization framework built with the goal of making the visual representation of complex data easy for everyone.

Primarily conceived as a tool for designers and vis geeks, RAWGraphs aims at providing a missing link between spreadsheet applications and vector graphics editors. The project, led and maintained by DensityDesign was released publicly in 2013 and is regarded by many as one of the most important tools in the field of data visualization. The team responsible for the design, development and maintenance of the project is composed by DensityDesign, Calibro and Inmagik, who joined the team in 2019.
