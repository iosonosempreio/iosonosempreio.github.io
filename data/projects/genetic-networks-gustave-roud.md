The project provides a visual representation of the creative process followed by Gustave Roud in the making of some of his most famous literary works. We refer to these visualizations with the phrase “genetic networks”, because they support scholars in inquiring the genesis of literary works. This work is part of the bigger initiative entitled [Gustave Roud, «Œuvres complètes»](https://archive.ph/OLJRK), funded by the FNS.
The project draws from a meticulous collection conducted on the archive of Roud by a group of literary scholars. They examined diaries, notepads, and other preparatory materials in search for clues and evidences of development of Roud’s ideas and writings.
Outcomes of this work are a series of ten printed visualizations, based on network graphs and visually enriched with the use of metaphors (sky maps).
