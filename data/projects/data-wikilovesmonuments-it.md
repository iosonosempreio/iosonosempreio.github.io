A visualization platform designed for Wikimedia Italia. The project is built around *Wiki Loves Monuments Italy* (WLM), a contest that fosters the Wikimedia Community to depict and share photographs of monuments on Wikimedia Commons, under an open license. Thanks to the visualization, it is possible to explore Italian territories and display the photographic coverage of cultural properties over different time frames. By doing so, Wikimedia staff and volunteers can address the communityâ€™s effort and organize photographic or mapping activities.
