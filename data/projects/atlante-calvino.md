_Atlante Calvino. Literature and Visualization_ is a web platform for to visually exploring the corpus of narrative writings of Italo Calvino and learn about a series of literary inquiries conducted on his production. The project allowed designers and scholars to work together and to understand how to readapt tools and practices of data visualization in support of interpretive work of Literary Criticism.

The project gathers different forms of visualizations:

- _guide visualizations_, that give the measure of the entire corpus and allow for exploration
- _analysis visualizations_, reifications of literary inquiries and that are organized across three "itineraries"
- _in-depth analysis pages_, that discuss the analysis and point to some reading tips.
