The IEEE VIS Arts Program (VISAP) is a mini-conference and exhibition where visualization researchers, designers, and artists come together to showcase and discuss works at the intersection of data visualization, art and design. I was part in the organizing committee for the edition of 2022 and I took care of creating the website.
